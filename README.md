# Fraud Detection Machine Learning Model

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data. The model utilizes various algorithms to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download]. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

## Model Development
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and performed feature engineering.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Algorithms Used**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained models using training data and evaluated them using cross-validation.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimized model performance through grid search.
